## Process
My tribute page pays homage to one of my favorite music bands and one of the bestselling groups of all-time: TLC. You'll find short bios on each member, media quotes, career stats and a chronological discography section of their albums (collective and solo releases). **HTML5, CSS3, CSS Grid.**
