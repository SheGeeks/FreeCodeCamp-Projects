          <h3>Tionne "T-Boz" Watkins</h3>
          <p><b>April 26, 1970.</b> Born in Des Moines, Iowa, Watkin's family moved to Atlanta when she was 9. By 14,
            Watkins was taking part in a number of Atlanta hair competitions and working at hair salons. Watkins'
            nickname came about when her Atlanta friends would say, ‚ÄúTionne‚Äôs a boss.‚Äù As a child, she was diagnosed
            with sickle cell anemia, and would became one of the spokespersons for Sickle Cell Disease Association of
            America. In 2009, Watkins publicly shared her 3-year battle with a fatal brain tumor. She is a national
            co-chair of the progressive organization Health Care Voter.</p>

            trio The Lopes Kids with her siblings, with whom she sang gospel songs at local events and churches. In
            1990, Lopes moved to Atlanta to audition at an opening casting call for an new girl group, that would become
            TLC. Lopes took a spiritual retreat to Honduras to and had been in the process of setting up two educational

          <p><b>February 27, 1971.</b> Born in Columbus, Georgia, Thomas was first a dancer for Damian Dame. In 1991,
            she joined TLC, replacing founding member Crystal Jones, and was nicknamed "Chilli" by Lisa Lopes to retain
            the group's name, TLC. In 2012, Thomas started a non-profit organization called Chilli's Crew. The
            organization is an Atlanta program targeted to help girls between the ages of 13-17 with self-esteem issues.

        <p>"TLC's career has been filled with both hits and headlines. The group was one of the few R&B acts to build a
          strong identity out of its initial success, and they exerted more control over each successive record. Their
          music ‚Äì particularly the 11-million-selling CrazySexyCool and the 6-million-selling FanMail, both of which won
          two Grammys each ‚Äì set the standard for contemporary R&B. TLC helped to pioneer a deft blend of acoustic and
          computer sounds that paved the way for groups like Destiny's Child, as did their image as independent women.
          Whether addressing AIDS in 'Waterfalls' or the struggle for female self-esteem in 'Unpretty', they showed
          themselves able to take serious issues to the top of the pop charts."</p>
