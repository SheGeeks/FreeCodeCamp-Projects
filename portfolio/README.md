## Process
This personal portfolio project was built **mobile-first, is A11Y friendly, and uses semantic HTML5, CSS3, Flexbox.**. 

I created a simple design that centers around the porfolio projects: the projects I've completed for [FreeCodeCamp's  Responsive Design course](https://freecodecamp.org). Each project include a brief description and links to a live demo akong with the source code. I had the most fun playing with the link and text colors to create a color scheme that was both accessible and pleasing to look at. 

This is my final project for the course. I'm planning to continue practicing with additional courses in the future. Stay tuned!
